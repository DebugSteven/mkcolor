# mkcolor

This is a continuation of @quietmisdreavus's work.
I felt inspired to pick it up after working on a small art project.
I spent a good amount of time coming up with my own color palatte for
the project, but I was really happy with the end result. In turn it got
me curious about `mkcolor`. I spend a good amount of time looking at
terminal. It'd be really cool to make a terminal theme I really like. I
hope my additions to `mkcolor` will help me come up with custom themes I
enjoy.

*an experiment in randomized vim color schemes*

This project was inspired by the [random color contrasts][] Mastodon bot. I wanted to take the idea
of picking colors and measuring their color contrast, and scale it up to picking many different
colors and using them to create a somewhat-coherent text editor color scheme.

An eventual goal for this is to create an exporter that will create a valid Vim color scheme file
that you could add to your configuration. (A far-future goal might include getting this
randomization into a Vim plugin, but i don't want to get too far ahead of myself...)

The project is hosted at <https://quietmisdreavus.github.io/mkcolor/> using the master branch.
